      "We have a totally safe, steady, and cryptic fee portal for cash transactions. The facts of your credit score and card stay in the system's cache memory most effectively until the time you hold the transaction window open for your screen. The second you verify the transaction or maybe near the window, the cache memory of the system deletes all brief facts saved referring to the transaction. Therefore, there's no danger of leakage of any of your transactional facts through our servers. \n\n We reserve the right to reveal your private records as required through the law. The facts might be disclosed only when it becomes necessary for us to guard and protect our rights or to comply with any judicial proceeding, court order, or felony process served on our website. \n\n Payments made to the Legal Trademark Office as service fees will be reflected in your statement by the descriptor name of “Xtarlabs” as a third-party payment processor. \n\n We fully reserve the right to alter any of our privacy policy at any time and we can also additionally deem necessary without intimating you.
